## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
- Instagram
     Changing the background color of the messages screen
     Deleting old messages
- Snapchat
     Deleteing messages after 24 hours
     Stories/Private stories
- TikTok
     Short content that you can scroll through
     Filters
- Idea:
     A university specific pomodoro app. You set a timer and then then if you exit the app,
     then you lose your time. After each sucessful pomodoro period, it adds to your total
     amount. There will be a leader board in which the top 10 will win lion a certain amount 
     in lion cash(flexible prepaid account) that you can use anywhere on campus. Gamification aspect
     where the move you study the higher ranks you unlock. For example I could use the mascot of psu.
     Users start with a small nittany lion cub that grows larger the more they study.The lion could go 
     through different stages of growth, and perhaps gain accessories or features like a Penn State jersey, 
     a graduation cap, etc.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:
Just getting use to xcode and now where to find things.
